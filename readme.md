# purraxis

Organizing people with skills (or who want to learn them) to collaborate and work on projects that benefit their communities.

Will consist of a social network and a wiki, integrated together so people can talk about what they're doing to benefit their community.

Eventually a decision-making capability will be built.

# Development

Currently made for deployment on Google Cloud. Keep deployment-specific methods in `server/lib` only.
